# Words by Maugham

In this project, in order to practice my text analysis skill🧐, I scraped 25 accessible publications 📖 of British novelist [W. Somerset Maugham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Somerset_Maugham) from online library [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/126). I went through all his publications with over 1.5 million words ⚠️ and analyzed: 

- What are the words that were most and least commonly used by Maugham? 
- And how he wrote about his female and male characters?
