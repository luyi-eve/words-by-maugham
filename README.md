# Words by Maugham

In this project, in order to practice my text analysis skillüßê, I scraped 25 accessible publications üìñ of British novelist [W. Somerset Maugham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Somerset_Maugham) from online library [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/126). I went through all his publications with over 1.5 million words ‚ö†Ô∏è and analyzed: 

- What are the words that were most and least commonly used by Maugham? 
- And how he wrote about his female and male characters? 

#### About data folder:
- **raw-25_books_text.rtf & cleaned-25_books_text.rtf:** these are the raw data I pulled from the webpages along with a clean version I edited after so.
- **text analysis on books by Maugham.ipynb:** this is the major data analysis notebook that shows how I scrape, clean and prepare for further analysis.
- **most common words folder:** text analysis on most and least commonly used words by Maugham üîç.
- **verb by gender folder:** text analysis on gender verb dynamics.
